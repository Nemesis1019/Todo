Todo
A productivity app for everyone to create todo's.

It is part of my internship as a frontend specialization student.

In this practice I've favored the use of state, react context, I've created my own hook for data persistence in local storage, I also learned to use react portals but above all, I had a lot of fun.

You can access the app through the following link:
